Exercise 3: Lemon allergy

Your mom bought you a basket of fruit, because you're doing so well in HackYourFuture. How sweet of her!

const fruitBasket = ['Apple', 'Lemon', 'Grapefruit', 'Lemon', 'Banana', 'Watermelon', 'Lemon'];

However, she forgot that you are allergic to lemons! Let's quickly dispose of them before you get an attack.

    Write a function
    Use the filter array function to take out the lemons
    Output a string that says: "My mom bought me a fruit basket, containing [array of fruits] !"
