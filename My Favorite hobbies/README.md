Exercise 5: My favorite hobbies

I've got a couple of hobbies that I want to showcase in a webpage.

const myHobbies = [
  'Meditation',
  'Reading',
  'Programming',
  'Hanging out with friends',
  'Going to the gym',
];

    Write a program that outputs each of these inside an HTML file
    Create an HTML and JavaScript file, link them together
    Use the map and/or forEach function to put each hobby into a list item
    Output the list items in an unordered list
