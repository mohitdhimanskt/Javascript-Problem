Exercise 4: Collective age

const hackYourFutureMembers = [
  { name: 'Wouter', age: 33 },
  { name: 'Federico', age: 32 },
  { name: 'Noer', age: 27 },
  { name: 'Tjebbe', age: 22 },
];

    Write a program that calculates the combined age of every member
    Make use of the map function to get the ages

    The callback adds all the ages together and returns the number
    The main function should log the string "The collective age of the HYF team is: [number]" to the console, and afterwards return the number
